## March 5, 2025 - Test Suite Implementation

**Context:** The test suite needed to be fixed to properly mock document methods and browser APIs.

**Decision:** Implement robust test setup with proper mocks for browser APIs.

**Rationale:** Proper mocking is essential for reliable testing of browser-based applications, especially when dealing with IndexedDB and file operations.

**Implementation:** 
- Updated file-processor.test.js with proper mocking strategy
- Fixed issues with IndexedDB mocking in db.test.js
- Implemented comprehensive test coverage for all modules

## March 5, 2025 - Excel Multi-Sheet Support

**Context:** The PWA needed to handle Excel files with multiple sheets, as specified in the requirements.

**Decision:** Enhance the file-processor.js module to detect and handle Excel files with multiple sheets.

**Rationale:** Many workout programs are distributed as Excel files with multiple sheets, each containing different workout phases or variations. Supporting this format improves user experience and broadens compatibility.

**Implementation:**
- Modified the processFile function to detect multiple sheets in Excel files
- Added logic to return sheet names when multiple sheets are detected
- Implemented sheet selection functionality in the UI
- Updated Cypress tests to verify multi-sheet Excel file handling
- Fixed port configuration in package.json and cypress.config.js for consistent testing
