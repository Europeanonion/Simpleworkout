## 2025-03-05 - PWA Architecture Design Decisions

### Decision 1: Modular Architecture
**Context:** Need for a scalable and maintainable Progressive Web Application
**Decision:** Implement a modular architecture with separate concerns
**Rationale:** 
- Improves code organization
- Enhances maintainability
- Allows easier future extensions
**Implementation:** 
- Created separate modules for:
  * Database management (db.js)
  * File processing (file-processor.js)
  * User interface (ui.js)
  * Main application logic (app.js)

### Decision 2: IndexedDB for Data Storage
**Context:** Limitations of LocalStorage for workout tracking
**Decision:** Replace LocalStorage with IndexedDB
**Rationale:**
- Higher storage capacity
- Better performance for complex data
- Supports more advanced querying
- Enables more robust offline functionality
**Implementation:**
- Developed comprehensive IndexedDB wrapper in db.js
- Created object stores for workouts, exercises, and progress
- Implemented methods for saving, retrieving, and managing workout data

### Decision 3: Offline-First Architecture
**Context:** Need for reliable workout tracking without constant internet connection
**Decision:** Implement service worker for comprehensive offline support
**Rationale:**
- Ensures app functionality without internet
- Provides seamless user experience
- Improves performance through caching
**Implementation:**
- Created service-worker.js with:
  * Asset caching
  * Fetch event handling
  * Background sync preparation

### Decision 4: Mobile-First Responsive Design
**Context:** Primary target platform is iPhone
**Decision:** Develop mobile-first CSS with specific iOS optimizations
**Rationale:**
- Ensures optimal user experience on mobile devices
- Handles iPhone-specific design challenges (notches, safe areas)
- Provides responsive layout across different screen sizes
**Implementation:**
- Used CSS env() for safe area insets
- Created mobile-specific touch target sizes
- Implemented responsive typography and layout

### Decision 5: Minimal External Dependencies
**Context:** Need for lightweight, performant application
**Decision:** Minimize external library usage
**Rationale:**
- Reduce bundle size
- Improve load times
- Minimize potential security vulnerabilities
**Implementation:**
- Used vanilla JavaScript
- Bundled only essential libraries (SheetJS for file parsing)
- Implemented custom modules instead of using heavy frameworks
