## Work Done

### Testing Framework Implementation
- Set up Jest testing environment with proper configuration
- Created mock implementations for browser APIs (IndexedDB, File API)
- Implemented test setup file with necessary mocks and polyfills
- Added test data fixtures for realistic testing scenarios

### Module Tests
- Created comprehensive test suite for file-processor module
  - Tests for CSV parsing and validation
  - Tests for error handling (empty files, invalid formats)
  - Tests for data formatting and transformation
- Implemented database module tests
  - Tests for IndexedDB operations (CRUD)
  - Tests for workout and exercise data management
  - Tests for progress tracking functionality
- Added UI module tests
  - Tests for rendering workout data
  - Tests for error handling and loading states
  - Tests for UI state management
- Created app integration tests
  - Tests for file upload handling
  - Tests for workout loading and saving
  - Tests for exercise progress tracking

### Excel Multi-Sheet Support
- Enhanced file-processor.js to detect and handle Excel files with multiple sheets
- Added logic to return sheet names when multiple sheets are detected
- Implemented sheet selection functionality in the UI
- Updated Cypress tests to verify multi-sheet Excel file handling
- Fixed port configuration in package.json and cypress.config.js for consistent testing

### Code Improvements
- Enhanced error handling in file processing module
- Improved module structure with clear separation of concerns
- Added proper export/import patterns for better testability
- Implemented robust mocking strategies for external dependencies

### Documentation
- Updated decision log with testing strategy and architecture decisions
- Documented system patterns and product context
- Created comprehensive test documentation

## Next Steps

### User Experience Enhancements
- Implement sheet preview during selection
- Add visual feedback for completed exercises
- Implement progress visualization (charts, graphs)
- Add workout history view

### Mobile Optimization
- Test on actual iPhone devices
- Optimize touch interactions
- Ensure proper handling of notches and safe areas

### Performance Optimization
- Implement lazy loading for workout data
- Optimize IndexedDB operations for large datasets
- Add caching strategies for frequently accessed data

### Deployment
- Set up continuous integration pipeline
- Configure automated testing
- Deploy to hosting platform (Netlify, GitHub Pages)
- Verify PWA installation flow on iOS
