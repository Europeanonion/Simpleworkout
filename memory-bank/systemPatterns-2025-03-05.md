## System Patterns Observed

### Architectural Patterns
1. **Modular Architecture**
   - Separation of concerns
   - Independent, reusable modules
   - Clear responsibility boundaries
   - Easy to test and maintain

2. **Offline-First Design**
   - Service worker for caching
   - IndexedDB for persistent storage
   - Resilient to network interruptions
   - Seamless user experience across connectivity states

3. **Progressive Enhancement**
   - Core functionality works without advanced features
   - Graceful degradation
   - Supports wide range of device capabilities

### Data Management Patterns
1. **Repository Pattern**
   - Abstraction of data storage operations
   - Centralized data access logic
   - Supports multiple storage backends
   - Simplifies data manipulation

2. **Schema Validation**
   - Strict data structure enforcement
   - Prevents invalid data entry
   - Ensures data integrity
   - Provides clear contract for data shape

### UI/UX Patterns
1. **Mobile-First Responsive Design**
   - Adaptive layout
   - Touch-friendly interfaces
   - Safe area and notch handling
   - Performance-optimized rendering

2. **Component-Based UI**
   - Encapsulated, reusable UI elements
   - Clear state management
   - Improved code organization
   - Easy to extend and modify

### Performance Patterns
1. **Minimal Dependency Strategy**
   - Lightweight application
   - Reduced bundle size
   - Faster load times
   - Lower memory consumption

2. **Lazy Loading**
   - On-demand resource loading
   - Improved initial load performance
   - Reduced memory footprint

### Security Patterns
1. **Client-Side Data Protection**
   - No server-side storage
   - Local data encryption potential
   - User privacy preservation

2. **Secure Offline Storage**
   - IndexedDB with potential encryption
   - Isolated storage per origin
   - Browser-level security mechanisms

### Development Patterns
1. **Continuous Integration Readiness**
   - Modular architecture supports easy testing
   - Webpack configuration for build process
   - Clear separation of concerns

2. **Documentation-Driven Development**
   - Comprehensive decision logging
   - Clear architectural documentation
   - Traceable development process
